    <h3>ABOUT APP</h3>
    <p>
      It is a simple Vue.js app to create a list of your to-do-list of books you
      wanna read (hopefully soon!). That is why I called it "to-read-list".
    </p>
    <h4>Why I did this project?</h4>
    <p>
      1- I have lots of to-read books, and well, it was fun to create a list for
      it! (as if this is the problem! not having a vue.js app at hand!), and,<br />
      2. We are using Vue.js in our team now and I really needed to feel
      confident about it! So I found a tutorial and cusomized it.
      <br />It is actually a nice weekend that I am developing this app. The
      most challenging problem for me was insatlling vue-roter, as I used Vue2,
      and the router was the last version and it was making some build issues.
